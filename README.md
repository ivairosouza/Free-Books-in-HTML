# Project Gutenberg HTML Enhancements

Welcome to my repository! Here, I share improved versions of HTML books downloaded from Project Gutenberg. These books are optimized for better readability, especially for those learning a new language like me.

## About Me

Hi, I'm **Ivair Oliveira Souza**, a Brazilian who is passionate about learning. Although I'm not a programmer, I have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. Currently, I'm learning English and came across the [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/) website, which offers over 70,000 books in various formats, including online, EPUB3, EPUB, KINDLE, and HTML.

While exploring the HTML books, I noticed they had small text, excessive side margins, and a minimal design, making them harder to read. I decided to edit these books to improve their readability and make them more user-friendly.

## Project Goal

This repository is dedicated to sharing these enhanced HTML books with others, especially those:  
- Learning a new language.  
- Using low-resource smartphones.  
- Looking for lightweight book formats for easy downloads.  

HTML is the smallest format available for books, making it ideal for users with limited resources. The enhancements include:  
- Larger, more readable fonts.  
- Reduced margins for better use of screen space.  
- Improved overall design for a pleasant reading experience.  

All books include links to resources like [Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), [Librivox](https://librivox.org/), and [Archive.org](https://archive.org/) to access related images and audio.

All books offered in this repository contain a Project Gutenberg license section at the end of the book.

## How You Can Help

I welcome any contributions to improve and expand this project!  
Feel free to:  
- Suggest enhancements to the HTML/CSS.  
- Contribute optimized books.  
- Share ideas to make this project more impactful.

Together, we can make learning more accessible and enjoyable for everyone!
